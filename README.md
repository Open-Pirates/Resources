# Open Pirates Resources.
This repository contains all the resource phase files for Open Pirates.
These files are provided as-is with absolutely no warranty, or licensing of any kind. It should be noted that the Toontown Online assets are still the property of The Walt Disney Company and as such should only be used for reference purposes.

Asset files contained within this repository may potentially be modified slightly in order for compatibility with newer revisions of the Panda3D engine, however they are still ultimately the property of The Walt Disney Company, unless otherwise noted.
